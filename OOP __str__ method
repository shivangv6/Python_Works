"""
Create a class called AppleBasket whose constructor accepts two inputs: a string representing a color,
and a number representing a quantity of apples. The constructor should initialize two instance variables: apple_color and 
apple_quantity. Write a class method called increase that increases the quantity by 1 each time it is invoked. 
You should also write a __str__ method for this class that returns a string of the 
format: "A basket of [quantity goes here] [color goes here] apples." e.g. "A basket of 4 red apples." or "A basket of 50 blue apples." 
(Writing some test code that creates instances and assigns values to variables may help you solve this problem!)
