"""
Task
Given 2 sets of integers, M and N, print their symmetric difference in ascending order. The term symmetric difference indicates those values that exist in either M or N but do not exist in both.

Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer, M.
The second line contains M  space-separated integers.
The third line contains an integer, N.
The fourth line contains N space-separated integers.

Output Format

Output the symmetric difference integers in ascending order, one per line.
